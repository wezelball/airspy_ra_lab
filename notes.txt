 1=enabled(12bits packed), 0=disabled(default 16bits not packed)
[-f frequency_MHz]: Set frequency in MHz between [24, 1900] (default 900MHz)
[-a sample_rate]: Set sample rate
[-t sample_type]: Set sample type, 
 0=FLOAT32_IQ, 1=FLOAT32_REAL, 2=INT16_IQ(default), 3=INT16_REAL, 4=U16_REAL
[-b biast]: Set Bias Tee, 1=enabled, 0=disabled(default)
[-v vga_gain]: Set VGA/IF gain, 0-15 (default 5)
[-m mixer_gain]: Set Mixer gain, 0-15 (default 5)
[-l lna_gain]: Set LNA gain, 0-14 (default 1)
[-g linearity_gain]: Set linearity simplified gain, 0-21

[-d]: Verbose mode


TYPICAL COMMAND LINE

./airspy_rx_lab -r testairspy -f 99 -t 3 -n 5000000 -d

Currently plotting crashes if number of samples set to 10e6, which should
be 1 second of data.
